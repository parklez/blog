I had few job oppotunities arriving at my LinkedIn page recently for DevOps careers and I realized I'm not well acquainted with the variety of tools out there - I've only been using Travis (really simple things) and the in-house solution my company is doing at the moment.

I didn't know what to expect but was definitely surprised to see how fast and relatively easy I was able to pull this together.
I still want to use my own steps instead of copying from another user but for a starter this is fine.
Good thing is that I don't need to run my own static builds anymore, nor do I have to commit to the master branch!
