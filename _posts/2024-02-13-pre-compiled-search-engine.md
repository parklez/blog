I just recently used [Codeium](https://codeium.com/) to fix my curiosity of "AI" to assist me in my personal coding sessions, and well, it does help with some optimization or suggesting better names but if I didn't know any better it wouldn't be able to write something decent out of it. Overall a fun/productive thing I'll have around for now.

After writing down a simple script to save pre-compiled json pages, I now want to find relevant text within my notes. Aka I need a search engine of sorts. I won't really expand too much into it, I might write my own rudimentary one but for now I'll leave this note with some references. Bye! \
